_Learn the 50 states of the United States in a fun and interactive way!_

📖 Description
-------------
The U.S. States Game is an interactive educational project designed to help users learn the 50 states of the United States. This project utilizes the turtle graphics library in Python to create a interactive map of the United States, where users can click on a state to learn its name and location. The game is designed to be fun and engaging, making it an ideal tool for students, teachers, and anyone looking to improve their knowledge of U.S. geography.

The project is built using Python, with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. The code is well-structured and readable, making it easy for developers to contribute to the project or modify it to suit their needs. The game is also highly customizable, allowing users to add or remove features as desired.

One of the key features of the U.S. States Game is its ability to track user progress and provide feedback on correct and incorrect answers. This makes it an ideal tool for students who are looking to learn the states in a fun and interactive way. The game also includes a high score feature, which allows users to compete with themselves or others to see who can learn the most states in the shortest amount of time.
